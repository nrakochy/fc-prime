## fc-prime

Generating prime numbers without std-lib. 

## Usage
To see the CLI output, you can use `lein run`, or, if you prefer java, `lein uberjar` and then `java -jar target/fc-prime-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`

To see tests, `lein test` should do it.

`fc-prime.core` has the prime number functionality, which you can include in a project or from the REPL if you want to generate prime numbers.
